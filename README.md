## Introduction
On-campus events make up campus culture and can heavily impact a student's college experience. Unfortunately, when looking for an event, students have to search through a multitude of social media sites that are often full of unrelated information. Our app EventLife aims to be a simple app that focuses on events and factors that may affect one's decision to go to an event by listing events made by friends, giving the option to explore all events at UCSD, and maintaining private profiles for all, which ensures the app's primary focus is event planning rather than social media.
